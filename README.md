# Diamond Price Estimation Data Analysis

## Project Overview

In this data analysis project, I explored the fascinating world of diamond pricing using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. My primary objective was to create a robust model for predicting diamond prices based on a diverse set of attributes, including carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and physical dimensions. Below, I outline the key steps and insights from this analysis:

## Data Collection

- Acquired a comprehensive dataset containing details on thousands of diamonds, including carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and physical dimensions.
- The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, a reputable data platform known for its high-quality datasets.

## Data Analysis and Model Development

- Utilized Python and popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data analysis.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution and relationships among different diamond attributes.
- Created data visualizations, including histograms and count plots, to visualize price distributions, cut quality frequencies, color variations, and clarity levels.
- Encoded categorical features like "cut," "color," and "clarity" into numerical values to prepare them for modeling.
- Developed predictive models to estimate diamond prices, including Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Median Absolute Error (MedAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Feature Engineering

- Created additional features to potentially enhance model performance.
- Experimented with polynomial features to capture potential non-linear relationships between carat weight and price.
- Analyzed the relationship between price and carat weight using scatter plots to visualize data patterns.

## Results

- The analysis provided insights into the distribution and relationships of various diamond attributes, aiding in understanding the factors influencing diamond prices.
- The models, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest Regression, enabled the prediction of diamond prices with varying levels of accuracy.
- The Random Forest Regression model demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy, explaining approximately 98.14% of the variance in diamond prices.
- Feature importance analysis revealed that carat weight was the most influential attribute, followed by cut quality, clarity, and color, in determining diamond prices.

## Conclusion

This analysis serves as a valuable resource for consumers, jewelers, and industry professionals seeking to make informed decisions regarding diamond purchases and pricing strategies. While the code and analysis did not explicitly address missing values, outliers, or data validation, it provided essential insights into the diamond market's pricing dynamics and predictive modeling techniques.
